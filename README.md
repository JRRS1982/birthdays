# Project title

TDD Birthdays Project.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to develop my skills as a developer by running through a beginners TDD project.

### Requirements
I want a program that I can load in IRB that allows me to
- Store all of my friends’ birthdays so I can keep track of them
- See them all at once with their names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format
- Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays I have stored and check each one to see if it’s someone’s birthday, and tells me something like "It's Mary Poppin's birthday today! They are 124 years old!" - otherwise it won't say anything.

More requirements:
- Test-drive extracting a birthday class
- Isolate your birthday list class using a mock for Birthday

## Build status
The programme was built in Ruby v2.5.0, using VSCode editor. 

## Code style
Rubocop was used for linting.

## Features
This is a simple project, which should be test driven in design and should meet all the requirements shown above. 

## Installation
irb can be used to rub the programme. 

## Tests
RSpec was initialized and run on the programme to lead its development. 

## Contribute
No contributions are required for this practice project.
