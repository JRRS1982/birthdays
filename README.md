# Project title

TDD Birthdays Project.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to develop my skills as a developer by running through a beginners TDD project.

### Requirements

I want a program that I can load in IRB that allows me to

- Store all of my friends’ birthdays so I can keep track of them

- See them all at once with their names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format

- Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays I have stored and check each one to see if it’s someone’s birthday, and tells me something like "It's Mary Poppin's birthday today! They are 124 years old!" - otherwise it won't say anything.

More requirements:

- Test-drive extracting a birthday class

- Isolate your birthday list class using a mock for Birthday

## Build status / notes

All Rspec tests passing and linted. Have not yet completed the code for working with dates, will probably need to use the .parse method on an input date string to convert it into a date class which can then be used to check todays date vs friends birtday. Have not yet had the time to complete the coding. Hoping will revert to it and complete at a later date.

## Code style

Rubocop was used for linting. The programme was built in Ruby v2.5.0, using VSCode editor.

## Features

This is a simple project, which should be test driven in design and should meet all the requirements shown above.

## Installation

irb can be used to rub the programme.

## Tests

RSpec was initialized and run on the programme to lead its development.

## Contribute

No contributions are required for this practice project.

## Credits

Makers Academy provided the exercise to complete.
